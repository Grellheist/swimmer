# Whisker

This is a Twitter Clone, not to be taken seriously. 

It was developed to be put on my Portfolio and for learning purposes. It
will not be maintained after finished.

## Challenges

- Had a really hard time styling it because I'm not very good at this, but
nonetheless it was a pretty enjoyable experience, and it came out looking
pretty good.

- Some of the UX functionality was surprisingly hard to pull off at first, as
  I'm not too used to NextJS 13 and there aren't too many materials online to
  help me with the problems. For instance, getting the selected button in the
  sidebar to be semibold was way harder than expected, because I tried with
  hooks first (and later realized that it was much easier to look to the
  path name and add the semibold prop based on that). 

- I am working with a lot of technology that I'm not too used to, like Clerk
  and Prisma. Getting Clerk to behave like I wanted it to was kinda hard, but
  their documentation is actually pretty good, so it didn't take me too long.

- Prisma I'm still looking at the docs to figure out how I'm going to proceed,
  and I will update this README when I do figure it out.

- After finally figuring out how to use Prisma with NextJS 13.3 to create a
  post, now the problem is fetching all the existing posts. However, I do feel
  like I have a pretty good idea on how to do that and that one shouldn't take
  too long. Creating a post was super hard to figure out though, because
  documentation isn't very available for the newest versions and most tutorials
  are super outdated.

- Alright, figured out how to fetch the posts and what not, but I've created
  kind of a mess. Using my Post component will be a little hard the way things
  are right now, let's see how I solve this.

- Figured out how to fetch all the info I need, now just the final push. All
  that's left now is to allow users to post images, and create the other routes.

- About 99% done with this project, might be finishing it soon. However, my
  current job is kinda preventing me from putting more effort into this project
  for now, so I'll take my time.

- Hey it's done, the website is finished. I'm very proud with the results, but I
  do see where it could get better. For instance, I've made a lot of API calls
      to the database and that makes the performance tank quite a bit.

- Btw I stole Theo's <a href="https://github.com/t3dotgg/chirp">Chirp</a>
  profile page styling, because I still suck at styling.

### Disclaimer

I was going to brand this as Swimmer with a fish as the pet but my
crazy-cat-lady girlfriend (it's a joke I love her) convinced me otherwise.
