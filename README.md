# Whisker

This is a Twitter Clone, not to be taken seriously. 

It is being developed to be put on my Portfolio and for learning purposes. It
will not be maintained after finished.

## Challenges

- Had a really hard time styling it because I'm not very good at this, but
nonetheless it was a pretty enjoyable experience, and it came out looking
pretty good.

- Some of the UX functionality was surprisingly hard to pull off at first, as
  I'm not too used to NextJS 13 and there aren't too many materials online to
  help me with the problems. For instance, getting the selected button in the
  sidebar to be semibold was way harder than expected, because I tried with
  hooks first (and later realized that it was much easier to look to the
  path name and add the semibold prop based on that). 

- I am working with a lot of technology that I'm not too used to, like Clerk
  and Prisma. Getting Clerk to behave like I wanted it to was kinda hard, but
  their documentation is actually pretty good, so it didn't take me too long.

- Prisma I'm still looking at the docs to figure out how I'm going to proceed,
  and I will update this README when I do figure it out.

### Disclaimer

I was going to brand this as Swimmer with a fish as the pet but my
crazy-cat-lady girlfriend (it's a joke I love her) convinced me otherwise.
